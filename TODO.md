# TODO (Overview)
Just moves from 2 teams, just 2 teams focus

I need to finish all the moves, and I need better testing cause I'm worrying things won't work correctly-

## Today
Flinching (add state, check start of turn, then etc)
Then Rock Slide is done
Onto Stomping Tantrum

## Current Thoughts
Thinking about the generic state stuff
volatile status can work independently, so I can do just 0-1 state
for multiple targets, i need the power_set for it to work correctly
for multiple stats, this is never a case (at least as an AI says)


## Future todos and cleanup
- damage calc is invalid on lower end, review
- speed / priority (going to use a [priority, speed, action] queue)
- team implementation, switch/faint


## Today

Lets do turns.
Then I'll do Solar Beam, and then Stomping logic

Solar Beam can't be done cause I have no turn end for charging right now
Stomping Tantrum next... failed move time, neat
    This also requires turn end, ok lets just do this imo
Then Fake Out - (speed priority)
Throat Chop needs a data field for turns remaining
Matcha Gotcha drain needed

# Long Goal

Need easier pokemon & move creation, going to make a central library to contain all
Then more testing with spread moves
Then I'll implment abilities

Create something that checks all pokemon and selects a random move
    - Also need to add additional actions (mega, switching)

Adding the condition that match ends when all pokemon on one side are dead

Then going to validate the damage calc with stats and then natures
